# Machine-Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In other words, machine learning algorithms can analyze and learn from data, and use that knowledge to make predictions, identify patterns, or make decisions.
