# Machine-Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In other words, machine learning algorithms can analyze and learn from data, and use that knowledge to make predictions, identify patterns, or make decisions.
Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and many others. The success of machine learning models depends on the quality of the data, the selection of appropriate algorithms, and the tuning of hyperparameters. Machine learning is an active research area with many new techniques and applications emerging regularly.


TOPICS:
1. Regression analysis: linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression, etc.
